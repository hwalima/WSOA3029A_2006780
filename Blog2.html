    <h2>Data Driven Story telling</h2>
    <h4>
        A significant amount of time is spent crafting and retelling stories. These are narratives that shapes the community or reflect to the community. Story telling is therefore an ongoing link between a restorative and a reflective lens of the daily lives of people. <br><br>
        I will focus on the storytelling in the digital spaces, with a focus on the internet using websites as a door that the audience uses to access stories. When we begin to manipulate the semiotic devices in telling a story, we as the artist are aiming to frame a story in a way that we want it to be received. <br><br>
        Ferdinand de Saussure’s theory on semiotics helps resolve the concept of how what we see is aligned to what and how the society enforces it. In her contribution on the implications on data storytelling (Tversky, 2018) draws comparisons between the people as a community and the data as a community in storytelling. Barbara Tversky further argues that data driven storytelling employs visualization devices borrowed from visual storytelling, which explored ideas of how time space and objects are represented to frame a message. <br><br>
        Concurring with Tversky, I put forward that these devices are either reductionist, emphasizing, othering or they use stereotype. These are made possible by how graphics use space and elements to represent this. A simple graph can be represented in many ways to give many meanings. <br><br>

        The two graphs below might have the same values, but their color representation might mean different things. <br><br>
<a> <img src="./Assets/vis1.png" style="height:8.5cm;flex-direction: row; align-content:center;"></a>
<a> <img src="./Assets/vis2.png" style="height:8.5cm;align-content:center"></a>
<br><br>
Data that is visualized on the web represents information as objects and scenes and events that are embedded in the discourse of storytelling. This means that all the devices used in story telling can be used in driving a story using data visualizations.
<br><br>
Description using data
Timelines, storyboards, hierarchy of importance can be used in describing space, time, or an environment. All these devices are used within the discourse of storytelling to frame the way we want the audience to interpret or perceive the data we offer them. (Tversky, 2018) further argues that when describing a space or environment, people typically begin with an overview or with an entrance. The question to us who are responsible for data visualization is therefore: what entry point to we drive the audience to.
<br><br>
Explanation using data
This can be achieved by creating data visualization that justifies an occurrence or a situation. The layout is important here, as the structure portrays either temporality or permanence. For example, when using a pie chart, how would one represent parts and the whole?  The images below shows  doughnut charts, but drawn differently. This gives the reader a different version of their eye’s entry point when reading the data.
<br><br>
<a> <img src="./Assets/vis3.png" style="height:8.5cm;flex-direction: row; align-content:center;"></a>
<a> <img src="./Assets/vis4.png" style="height:8.5cm;align-content:center"></a>
<br><br>
Stories using data
Because people like to hear a story in a pattern and a classified manner, it is therefore easy for a visualization of data to follow the same way of storytelling. When the data layout is confusing and there seems to be not clearly define entry point for the eye, the audience is thrown off pattern. At this stage, they cannot see a patter and therefore cannot see a story. 
The numbers [1,3,5,7,9,11,13] are easy to follow since the pattern is incremental.
On the other hand, the same numbers [9,13,3,7,5,11,1] do not seem tom represent any story. The person visualizing the data therefore must further explain the story that the aim to tell.
