    <h2>The politics in Visualisations</h2>
    <div class="blog-background">
    <h4 class="Bog-Text">
        On his work of how representations affect our personal perceptions of the world we live in, Webb argues that representation is implicated in the process of situating ourselves in the world (Webb 2009: 3).  Kidd puts forward that representation is a crucial device in the processes we go through in forming our own identities and how we express differences created by cultures and communities. <br> <br>

        Drawing from the theorical work on semiotics by Saussure (1959) and the constructivist approach (Hall,1997) as coined by Stuart Hall in his work on representation, we can extend the politics of semiotics to how everyday works of media is shaped by who says what to who and how. Concurring with Kidd, on how language shapes the perception of the world around us, draws me back to the theory on the medium as a message as argued by (McLuhan,1964). If the medium this as a container of a message is more important than the message itself, then the politics around the semiotic devices of that medium, is equally important.<br> <br>

        The Saussurean theory on semiotics, as championed by (Saussure 1959) frames the separation of a sign to its signifier and signified. However, the arbitrariness of the connection between the signifier and the signified remains, and culture and communal conventions of language help to resolve this arbitrariness, while also enforcing it. <br> <br>

        Kidd, 2016:22) argues that for media semiotics, the overarching influence is how the content is then separated from the form. Drawing from Kidd’s argument, I pursue to offer that the choices we make in how we represent interactive media like a website matter. The choice of a color palate, the size and positioning of pictures is crucial in how the eyes of a website user is directed. <br><br>

        It is therefore imperative that in an era where the affordances of technologies enable us to be daily consumers and producers of information, we should become aware of how the use semiotics devises to further objectives, situate power, and frame a narrative.  It goes without saying that our own prejudices and socio-cultural biases influence the way we construct and read the signs in digital media. <br><br>
        In their analysis of Capcom’s Resident Evil 5, (Geyser and Tshabalala, 2011) argue that the representation of Africa in a homogenised way, becomes problematic because it assumes that everyone in Africa uses the same conventions in life. This lack of thorough research by Capcom caused a stir in the gaming world, where the consumers of the media found the semiotic devices used to represent women, and Africa over simplified and generalized. <br><br>

        On a denotative level, a visitor of a website applies a definite meaning or grouping of meanings of to a sign that is widely accepted by most people, as distinguished from the idea or concept associated with that sign. On a connotative level however, a sign is not necessarily described or interpreted in its basic form, but a further interpretation that is influenced by wider social ideologies is employed. This further interpretation tends to take a certain form or combination of forms, e.g. negative, positive, personal, and cultural. What a font, pictures and text in a website mean , is therefore not fixed, it is a myth (Barthes 1973:109) contends that myth is a type of message that is conveyed by discourse and is not defined by the object of its message, but by the way it utters the message. <br><br>

        (Kidd, 2016:28) further argues that the range of experiences and ideas that we bring with us to our reading of a text will affect what we take away from it. Borrowing from this argument , I propose that connotations and conventions of production in digital media, like the choice of colors, website pages priorities etc., will inevitably affect how we as producers in digital media, read other works produced by other people. <br> <br>
